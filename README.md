## DWTVIZ

This library creates a visualization of a discrete wavelet transform of a signal.
It vertically aligns the signal and heatmap to help the viewer gain an intuition
for how the wavelet coefficients relate to the signal.

For more details and example usage, please see the 
[demo notebook](https://github.com/n-s-f/dwtviz/blob/master/dwtviz/examples.ipynb).

#### Installation

```
pip install dwtviz
```
